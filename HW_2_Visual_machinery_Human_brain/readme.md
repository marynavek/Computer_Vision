-	Just as you learned about the different edge operators, create your own operators to mimic the behavior (operational structure) of simple cells 
-	Indicate what angular resolution you have achieved (10ยบ is ideal but others are also acceptable) and what threshold you have used to decide whether a pixel is an edge point or not
-	Combine (superimpose) all the edge extraction results you have obtained in (1)
-	Contrast these results to the directional Kirsch operator
-	Contrast these results to another edge operator of your choice with the 8 gradient directions and again superimpose the results. An example will be the Prewitt compass already given to you.
-	Make use of multiple operators (mimicking simple cells) but with different degrees of fuzziness on blurred images or on images that have things like clouds, waves in an ocean, and express your thoughts on the results.
