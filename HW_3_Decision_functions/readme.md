-	Create sample data using two classes that are separable linearly and implement the perceptron to determine an appropriate decision function.
-	Repeat this process and include data samples that will make the two classes not linearly separable and see if the perceptron still works albeit with a lesser classification accuracy.
-	Implement the generalized decision function formulation (GDF) for the rth order and with n dimensions. Illustrate that your program works for the cases:

(a)	Second degree with 2 dimensions
(b)	Third degree with 2 dimensions
(c)	Second degree with 3 dimensions
(d)	Third degree with 3 dimensions

Perhaps initially you set all the weights to 1 and observe your results, then as you vary the different weights singularly, look at the change experienced in the various GDFs
